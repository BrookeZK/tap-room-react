# Tap Room

#### _React Independent Project 07.04.2019_

#### By _Brooke Kullberg_

## Description
_This is a point of sale system for a Tap Room. The application has a separate veiw for the employee and patron. The Patron view is what customers will see as a digital menu. They will see a list of all kegs with color coded information. There will also be a search function that allows users to sort by their desired metrics, for example, type of beer, alcohol by volume, or locality._

_The employee view offers the same list of available kegs and search functionalities, but wth more activities. Employees will be able to add and edit kegs, and create an order._

_This application is currently in-progress, so only the welcome page, employee home page, keg list and new keg page work._

_Enjoy!_
